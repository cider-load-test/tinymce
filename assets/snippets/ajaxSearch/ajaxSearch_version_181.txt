Previous version : 1.8.0 delivered the 24th July 2008

============================== NEW OPTIONS / CHANGES ==================================

==== AjaxSearch MySQL Query completely re-designed

     The SQL Query is now build to find in joined tables only the requested fields
     that match with the search terms.
     
     The list of id of concatened field is also available.
     
     For instance maxigallery provides the fields :
     - gal_title, gal_descr, gal_filename but also gal_id where gal_id is the list
     of the image id, listed in each gal_* fields.


==== Extend the search to others parts of a document - ADDON-24

    Until now AjaxSearch was limited to do the search into the content ("site_content" table)
    and partially into TVs linked to the document ("tmplvar_contentvalues" table).
    
    With the 1.8.1 version you could now define where to do the search (in which parts)
    For that a whereSearch parameter should be used:

     &whereSearch : define in which parts (tables) & elements (fields) the search occurs
     
     by default = "content|tv" allow the search in all the fields of content and tv values.
     
     The first key word should be the main table and the following the joined tables.
     
     Others defined key-words for the search are : 
     - jot : for a search in the jot comments ("jot_content" table)
     - maxigallery : for the search in maxigallery ("maxigallery" table)
     
     e.g: &whereSearch=`content,tv,jot,maxigallery` allows the search in all these parts of a document.
     
     You could also add your own tables where to do a search by defining your own keys.
     See demo on: http://www.modx.wangba.fr/index.php?id=180
     
     
     with 1.8.1 You could specify finely in which elements (fiels) do the search, like this:
     
     &whereSearch=`content:pagetitle,introtext,content|tv:tv_value|maxigallery:gal_title`
     
     For "content", elements available for a search are: 
      pagetitle, longtitle, description, alias, introtext, menutitle, content
    
     For "tv", elements available for a search are: 
      tv_value which a concatenation of all the values of tvs
      
     For "jot", elements available for a search are: 
      jot_content which is a concatenation of all the content comments
      
     For "maxigallery", elements available for a search are: 
      gal_title, gal_descr, gal_filename
      gal_filename is available for display


     By default the search occurs in all elements of each part:
     &whereSearch=`content,tv,jot,maxigallery` is equivalent to
     &whereSearch=`content:pagetitle,longtitle,description,alias,introtext,menutitle,
             content|tv:tv_value|jot:jot_content|maxigallery:gal_title,gal_descr,gal_filename`
    
     But you could also avoid the search in a table by using the "null" metacharacter:
     &whereSearch=`content:null|maxigallery:gal_title,gal_descr`    
     Here "content" is specify as the main table, but no fields are used in the search (:null).
     So all the documents are displayed. Search restriction occurs only in title and 
     description of Maxigallery documents
    


==== withTvs : Select the Tvs where to search. ADDON-24

      &withTvs = `comma separated list of tv names`
      
      e.g: &withTvs=`asTags1,asTags2` limit the search in tvs to "asTags1" and "asTags2"
      
      By default all the Tvs are used for the search
      Inexisting TVs are filtered and not taken into account


    
==== &filter : to exclude unwanted documents of the search
    
    &filter runs as the &filter Ditto 2.1 parameter. 
    (see http://ditto.modxcms.com/tutorials/basic_filtering.html)
    
    
    Added: ADDON-16: SearchString metacharacter available with &filter parameter
    
    e.g: &filter='tv_content,#,7' with search terms equal "word"
    is equivalent to &filter='tv_content,word,7'
    
    Limitation: the case of several words as search terms is not still managed
    neither the use of the advSearch.
    
    So with &filter='tv_content,#,7' and search terms equal "word1 word2"
    whatever the advSearch parameter is equivalent to &filter='tv_content,word1 word2,7'



====  Choose your search term from a predefined search word list

Now you could define a list of predefined search terms by using:

&searchWordList=`functionName,arg1,arg2,...` 

where myWordList is the name of a user function 
and arg1, arg2 , ... are new optional parameters of the function.
This parameters could be used to select depending the context, the right word list

e.g: &searchWordList=`myWordList,francais-utf8,[*id*]`

with the definition of the function functionName :

// searchWordList user function
// Uncomment and complete the core function and choose your own function name
// string functionName()
// functionName : name of searchWordList function passed as &searchWordList parameter
// params : array of parameters
// return a comma separated list of words

function myWordList($params){ 

  $language = $params[0];
  $docid = $params[1];
  
  switch($language) {

    case 'english-utf8':    
    switch($docid){

      case 61:
      $list = "primary,school,children,africa,education,teacher";
      break;
      
      case 62:
      $list = "parents,education,asia";
      break;
    }
    break;
    
    case 'francais-utf8':
    switch($docid){

      case 61:
      $list = "primaire,école,enfants,afrique,éducation,professeur";
      break;
      
      case 62:
      $list = "parents,éducation,asie";
      break;
    }
    break;
  }
  return $list;
}


==== debug : log some informations for debugging (or understanding of your results)

      &debug = [ 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 ]
      
      0 : the debug mode is not activated (Default)
      
      1 and 2: File mode )
      debug activated. Trace is by default logged into a file named ajaxSearch_log.txt
      in the ajaxSearch folder.
      
        1 : Parameters, search context and sql query logged. Records found are not logged
        2 : Parameters, search context, sql query AND Records found are logged
      
      To avoid an increasing of the file, only one transaction is logged. Overwritted 
      by the log of the following one.
      
      3 and 4: FireBug mode
      debug activated. The trace is logged into the firebug console of Mozilla.
      
        3 : Parameters, search context and sql query logged. Records found are not logged
        4 : Parameters, search context, sql query AND Records found are logged
        
        with the mode 3 and 4 you need to install:
        the Firebug plugin under Firefox : https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843
        and the FirePhp plugin (version 0.2.b.1 or upper) : http://www.firephp.org/
        
      For the mode 3 and 4, Php5 is mandatory. These 2 modes are switched to 1 and 2
      if you use Php4.
      
      For security reasons, the full name of tables (with database name) have 
      been replaced by short names (prefix + table name)
      
      The output produce the SELECT statement and you could use it directly by 
      copy & paste in PhpMyAdmin to retrieve your results and undertsand it.
    


====  Mootools or Jquery js library  - ADDON-19  >>>>>>>>>>>> FOR FUTURE USAGE

    &jscript ['jquery'|'mootools']
    Set this to jquery if you would like to include the jquery librairy
    Default: mootools
    
    e.g: &jscript=`jquery`
