SlimView Installation
=====================

SlimView.zip should contain the following files:
------------------------------------------------
changelog.txt
install.txt (the one you're reading now)
todo.txt
functions.php
index.php
legend.png.php
slimview.png.php
svconfig.php

To install SlimView:
--------------------
1. Unzip the files in SlimView.zip, keeping them in the 'SlimView' folder.
2. Edit the variables (sizes, colours) in the svconfig.php file if you like.
3. Place this folder in your SlimStat 'plugins' folder.
   E.g. www.example.com/slimstat/plugins/SlimView
4. Voila! You should now see an extra 'SlimView' tab at the top of your SlimStat pages.

To upgrade SlimView:
--------------------
Either:
1. Overwrite the complete SlimView folder.  None of your data will be affected.
Or:
1. Just overwrite the files that have changed by checking changelog.txt.

To uninstall SlimView:
----------------------
1. Just delete the SlimView folder.
2. Leave a message at www.igirisu.f2s.com as to why it's not to your liking.

Troubleshooting:
----------------
If no graphics are displayed (even though you've had visitors):
This is likely to be because the GD library (needed for creating graphics on-the-fly) is not enabled in your PHP installation. One way to confirm this is to create and upload a small PHP file (be sure to delete it when you've finished) containing just the following:
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
When you view the file in your browser, it should show all your PHP settings. Look for a GD section that shows PNG support is enabled. If it's not there, then you need to install it on your server or ask your web host to. Installation info is here:
