SlimView ToDo List
==================

In rough order of priority:

Fix Ingo's mysterious 'variable references' problem (http://groups.google.com/group/slimstat/browse_thread/thread/e9d44835eaa07049/fdb265335bb9cd7f).
Fix x label display problems (as of SlimStat 0.93).
Double check the data being used.
Highlight weekends in the daily view.
Possibly, at some stage, maybe think about perhaps making pie charts for platform, browser, etc.
