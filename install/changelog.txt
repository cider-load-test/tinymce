MOD 0.9.5 beta 3 (rev 1440 - September 17, 2006)
====================================

* Added fourth parameter to sendRedirect() function; this responseCode parameter can be used to pass in a valid HTTP redirect code to be set with a header() call (i.e. 'HTTP/1.1 301 Permanently moved'). (1440)
* Fixed paths in loadExtension so it does not produce the path with //manager (1440)
* Modified QuickEdit plugin to only execute if manager session is valid and to check if the Output class exists before calling include_once on it again.  Should save .02 to .1s per request when manager is not logged in. (1433)
* [FS#387] Fix for Firefox browser with caching features disabled. (1432)
* Updated the SLLists include for Doc Manager with full php tags. (1431)
* [FS#276] Error prevented empty tags being rendered when using HTML Generic Tag widget when no value is specified (same problem with Image widget was fixed by Adam in commit #869). (1431)
* [FS#259] Amended language string that was referencing snippets, and not chunks. (1431)
* [FS#198] This fix uses a session value to allow the full manager to refresh when a theme is changed and prevents the manager being locked in an endless loop. (1431)
* Added ability to delete categories (1430)
* Modified export_site.static.php to handle proper response codes (1429)
* Modified getSettings() to only include or load system/user settings once per request (1429)
* Remove hard coded default Manager style (1418)
* Add 'keywords' option to meta tag manager (1418)
* Updated Wayfinder to latest version for 0.9.5 beta2 build. (1396-1398)
* Fixed a few more broken image paths in manager files.
* Corrected broken image paths when rendering date TV field.
* index.php - fix for 'undefined index' for $_SESSION['mgrValidated'] on some setups when visitor is not logged in.
* [FS#181] Removed stripslashes() call prior to merging TVs into document, tested out on a range of content combos and TVs and haven't found any adverse effects.
* [FS#255] Added $modx->sendForward($docId, $httpResponseCode) method and modified all sendErrorPage and sendUnauthorizedPage functionality to use the new method with the proper response code.  You can use this to forward a request without redirection, to any MODx document with any valid HTTP response code that is appropriate.
* Removed all remaining references to the visitor log tables, except those in the Backup Manager, which will allow users to manipulate the legacy tables if still in their database following upgrade.
* Fixed some incorrect image paths in manager (eventlog_details.dynamic.php and Bottom Button Bar plugin)
* Added Document Manager language files to Manager (1381)
* Updated Prototype/Scriptaculous to 1.6.4 (1379)
* [FS#438] makeUrl() should use '&' for all query string parameters if '?' is present in FURL prefix. (1362)
* Tweak to allow weblogin to work with image button types (fixes IE failure) (1354)
* [FS#300] Missing doctype and opening HTML tag on outer frameset. Also updated JS call (language="JavaScript" --> type="text/javascript") (1348)
* [FS#170] Implement logic to ensure all cache files are deleted with clear cache (1347)
* [FS#458] Alter config.inc.php file to use single-quotes for DB name to allow for special characters ($ in particular) without parsing in php (1342)
* Updated Wayfinder in core installation.
* Fix membercheck snippet so that it works under PHP 4.3 and above. (1324)
* Added an empty config.inc.php.blank file (to rename in your FTP program) for convenience on new installs (1321)
* Added category support to all resource views and changed Categories tab to 'Combined View'
* Updated AjaxSearch snippet to only search docs they have access to.  Updated install to include changes and added Search Highlighting plugin to the install.
* [FS#170] Read the bug report (http://modxcms.com/bugs/task/170) for details, but basically, this kills the need to refresh multiple times to wipe out ALL cache files.
* [FS#458] The config.inc.php file was being written with all database login credentials surrounded with double quote marks. This made it so PHP wanted to interpolate the $ as a variable name rather than a literal character. The fix is simply to use single quote strings for that information.
* [FS#321] as directory structures such as: 2006/08/01 can now be created with friendly paths enabled (should please the bloggers ;) )
* [FS#308] and [FS#476] Problem where pages could be referenced from fictitious directories when friendly alias paths are enabled and a document ID is used in the URL. For example, http://mysite.com/made-up-directory/8 will have returned document 8 even though that directory doesn't exist. The fix ties document IDs to the virtual directory structure when friendly alias paths are used preventing document IDs being referenced outside of their location in the structure.
* [FS#414] Raymond's multi-select TV fix for saving TV values on PHP5. (has worked in majority of cases, but also appears it can be caused by some server configs)
* Another Datagrid widget fix, not bugtracked but discovered and fixed by Samba here:http://modxcms.com/forums/index.php/topic,6031.0.html

* [FS#345] removed unnecessary escaping in the string replacements in the decodeParamValue() function.
* [FS#491] Wrong resource browser opening for image and file TVs when editing a document.
* 'Delete/Undelete' option added to misc settings, published/unpublished option now respects 'publishedby,publishedon' fields
* Fix for broken image paths, updated paths to account for theme directories.
* [FS#490] numerous bug fixes for the Doc Manager module - see FS report for more details on the fixes. 
* Fix for category support, items wouldn't save unless category was set. (1319)
* Various manager theme tweaks and corrections from banzai. (1317,1318)
* [FS#328] This fix eliminates non-admin users from being able to create admin users. (1308,1310)
* [FS#440] Fixed problem for non-admin users not being able to change templates on a new document. (1295)

* Category helper functions created in file categories.inc.php (1243)

* Added ability to select if you want menuindex to automatically increment by default or not.
* [FS#280] Gives DBAPI object default connection values, but allows for others to override if specified - which is needed in some cases when connecting to a different db on the same server.
* Adds makeArray function to DBAPI so that you don't have to write the same stinkin' routine to array-ize a record set after each select statement result. Very handy. And works.
* Fixed form input fields for link_attributes and menutitle to be able to have double quotes.
* Patches for adding attributes to links
* Use a plain document ID as a weblink, and click on the Document Tree to set the ID you want.

* Improving the logic on getAffectedRows and getInsertID.(891)
* Added explicit call to $this->db->connect() in executeParser() function so when using mysql_real_escape_string() before any call to $this->db->query(), you would not get an error from the mysql_real_escape_sting function because no connection was available (888)
* Removing IE-specific contextual pop-up menu... now they all get the "Mozilla one" (881)
* [FS 195] Fixed a couple of warning notices. (879)
* Added support for mysql_real_escape_string for better multi-lingual support as per this request http://modxcms.com/forums/index.php/topic,3368.0.html, less the magic quotes fix because it might break things. (878)
